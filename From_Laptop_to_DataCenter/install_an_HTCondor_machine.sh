1) Security Group must allow tcp for ports 0 - 65535 from the same security group, i.e.:
 All TCP    TCP      0 - 65535     sg-008742ba0467986fe (aws_condor)
Security group must allow ping from the same security group, i.e.:
 All    ICMP-IPv4   All    N/A     sg-008742ba0467986fe (aws_condor)
Security group must allow ssh on port 22 from everywhere as ususal

##  This is the global configuration file for condor. This is where
